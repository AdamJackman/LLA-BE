#LLA-BE (LandLord App - Backend)

This project is designed to help independent landlords handle their tenants.
Companies such as AppFolio cater only to the larger business that handle complexes.

The goal of this project was to build a simple and easy way to:
- Manage Tenant Info
- Track House Issues
- Quickly replace tenants (post saved ads to CraigsList, Kijiji etc. APIs)
- Manage Documents
- I do not see acepting payments in the foreseeable future.
Currently an early WIP, will extend as time permits.

This is built with an express server as the backend.

##Running this project
The server will start up on port 3000 running the following commands
```
 npm install
 npm start
```

##Front-end
The front end is now contained in the front end folder.
It currently is only a WIP but is built using React.
